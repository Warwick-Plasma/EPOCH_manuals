Using a Monte Carlo approach we show that straggling effects arising from the finite recoil an electron experiences when it emits a high-energy photon, increase the number of pairs produced on further interaction with the laser fields.}

abstract = {Abstract In high-intensity ( &gt; 10 21 W cm − 2 ) laser–matter interactions gamma-ray photon emission by the electrons can strongly affect the electronʼs dynamics and copious numbers of electron–positron pairs can be produced by the emitted photons. We show how these processes can be included in simulations by coupling a Monte Carlo algorithm describing the emission to a particle-in-cell code. The Monte Carlo algorithm includes quantum corrections to the photon emission, which we show must be included if the pair production rate is to be correctly determined. The accuracy, convergence and energy conservation properties of the Monte Carlo algorithm are analysed in simple test problems.},

@article{Lehe2013,
abstract = {Transverse emittance is a crucial feature of laser-wakefield accelerators, yet accurately reproducing its value in numerical simulations remains challenging. It is shown here that, when the charge of the bunch exceeds a few tens of picocoulombs, particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations erroneously overestimate the emittance. This is mostly due the interaction of spurious Cherenkov radiation with the bunch, which leads to a steady growth of emittance during the simulation. A new computational scheme is proposed, which is free of spurious Cherenkov radiation. It can be easily implemented in existing PIC codes and leads to a substantial reduction of the emittance growth.},

@article{Cowan2013,
abstract = {We describe a modification to the finite-difference time-domain algorithm for electromagnetics on a Cartesian grid which eliminates numerical dispersion error in vacuum for waves propagating along a grid axis. We provide details of the algorithm, which generalizes previous work by allowing 3D operation with a wide choice of aspect ratio, and give conditions to eliminate dispersive errors along one or more of the coordinate axes. We discuss the algorithm in the context of laser-plasma acceleration simulation, showing significant reduction—up to a factor of 280, at a plasma density of 1023 m-3—of the dispersion error of a linear laser pulse in a plasma channel. We then compare the new algorithm with the standard electromagnetic update for laser-plasma accelerator stage simulations, demonstrating that by controlling numerical dispersion, the new algorithm allows more accurate simulation than is otherwise obtained. We also show that the algorithm can be used to overcome the critical but difficult challenge of consistent initialization of a relativistic particle beam and its fields in an accelerator simulation.},

Physical results on relativistic self-focusing in under- dense plasma are presented. It is shown that background plasma electrons are accelerated to multi-MeV energies and 10{\^{}}4 T magnetic fields are generated in the process of self-focusing at high laser intensities. This physics is crucial for the fast ignitor concept in inertial confinement fusion. Advances in the numerical PIC al- gorithm used in the code VLPL are reviewed here.},
